						<h3><div class="text_1">Purdue Space Program</div><div class="text_2">NX, Fusion 360 CAD and CAM, ANSYS & CNC machinery</div><div class="text_4">Purdue Space Program: Liquids is developing the Crater Maker Special, a bipropellant rocket with an expected apogee of 65,000 feet. I have taken part of the team on both the structures and manufacturing team to design, simulate, test, and manufacture critical rocket components. First, I lead the development of the launch lugs. The launch lugs are the interface between the rocket and the rail, and these must be able to handle the loads of the rocket, be adjustable, allow for portability, and be aerodynamic. Working as a team, we designed two sets of lugs in NX, simulated the parts using mesh convergence in ANSYS, and are now set to manufacture using CNC machinery. Another project I have led is the design and manufacturing of the mini-helium tube connectors. Our team is testing the load paths of a miniature/scale helium tube to determine the best composite structure, reliability, and strength of the helium tube portion of the rocket. To do this, our team designed in Fusion 360 and manufactured using the HAAS VF-2 CNC mill. Among other projects I have worked on in PSP-Liquids, is fin-can connections and interfacing with Liquid Oxygen bulkhead. Proper alignment and strength was crucial here in order to maintain rocket integrity.</div></h3>

						<h3><div class="text_1">Textron Aviation</div><div class="text_2">CATIA V5, ENOVIA V6 & Excel</div><div class="text_4">I interned in the summer of 2023 for Textron Aviation in Wichita, Kansas as a Special Missions Airframe Design Engineer. The first project I tackled was developing engineering efficiency materials for a newly contracted project. In doing so, I coordinated with people of all disciplines, including manufacturing technicians, electrical engineers, processes and materials, and the electromagnetic analysis team. Following this, I developed 10 outer mold line parts to be attached to the aircraft. I created technical engineering drawings and prepared the models for 3D printing using CATIA V5. And by the end of the summer, the parts were 3D printed. In addition, I extracted crucial part surfaces from the master file provided by the customer. These were then distributed and used by the engineering team. Throughout the summer, I continued to make sustainment revisions to Engineering Bills of Materials and drawings. These were done by evaluating material reliability, coordinating with vendors, dimensioning and tolerancing, and improving structural integrity.</div></h3>

						<h3><div class="text_1">Purdue Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop</div><div class="text_2">Mills, Lathes, & Other Advanced Machinery</div><div class="text_4">I began working in the Purdue Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop in the fall of 2023. In this position, I learned a great deal about the importance of quality, detail, and design for manufacturing. As a manufacturing assistant, I worked to help students, researchers, and faculty create their ideas from a block of stock. Working in the shop has allowed me to build a strong foundation in using advanced machinery, allowed me to work on a variety of projects, communicate my own ideas, and mentor students along the way.</div></h3>

As the Director of Industrial Relations, I have responsibility for leading the student organization, growing club impact, managing sponsors and external relations, developing relationships with alumni, holding professional development events, leading a team of 5 engineers, and mentoring club members. In addition, as part of my project management plan, I created a spreadsheet that is modeled off the Kanban method. The spreadsheet uses Javascript to automate the organization of tasks and help to distribute tasks to the team.</div></h3>

I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Yifan Sun to develop multi-GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) simulation software. The software that Dr. Sun and I developed a cycle based solution to produce crucial computing statistics at both the compute unit and SIMD specific level. In addition, the results create a visual breakdown as a CPI (cycles per instruction) stack to allow for easier performance scrutinization. During my time working with Dr. Sun, I utilized the Go Programming language and Github to create this efficient solution.</div></h3>

Beyond that, I improved my communication, leadership, and teaching skills in this position. When I was a TA, this was only the second or third semester offering the class to Purdue students. Thus, there was a large learning curve full of debugging both hardware and software as problems would arise. While sometimes frustrating, I learned lots about Raspberry Pi Microcontrollers and got my first use of Jupyter Notebook.</div></h3>

During this summer, I improved my technical programming skills, communication, teaching, and leadership skills. I was then selected as Director of Curriculum and took on more responsibility in developing material for the weekly classes that Steel City Codes offered to students around the world. Our team developed and grew the organization's impact by developing computer science and data science learning materials through Java and Python.</div></h3>
