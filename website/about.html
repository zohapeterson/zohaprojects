						<h3 class="text_5">I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Class of 2025.<br><br>My interests lie in technology and innovation and the improvements that they bring to Earth. I believe that our purpose as humans is to leave the Earth better than how we found it, and my medium in doing that is helping those around me through technology and innovation.<br><br>I have had the chance to tackle challenges and projects head on through my classes, extracurriculars, and my internship. I am excited to continue learning and growing my skillset for years to come.<br><br>There is no limit to what technology and innovation can achieve, and I aspire to make a big impact on it. Per aspera ad astra.</h3>
