					<h3 style="text-align: left; font-weight: lighter;">I am currently a sophomore at Purdue University studying Mechanical Engineering. On campus, I am involved with the Purdue American Society of Mechancial Engineers and the Purdue Space Program. I am absorbing information, solving problems, leading, and mentoring those around me.<br><br></h3>
					<h3 style="text-align: left; font-weight: lighter;">Why engineering? Well, I have always had a desire to have a great impact on powerful projects that drive technology and innovation. Now, as an engineering student, I have had the chance to do that. And looking toward the future, I have no intent to stop.<br><br></h3>
					<h3 style="text-align: left; font-weight: lighter;">Not only do I have a profound interest in the hardware aspects of engineering, ever since I was in middle school I have always loved to code. It was a free way to express my creativity, develop skills, and solve problems. It is also the future.<br><br></h3>
					<h3 style="text-align: left; font-weight: lighter;">Please feel free to reach out and network! I am always looking for new challenges to tackle, new opportunities to learn, and ways to solve problems, innovate, and be creative.</h3>
